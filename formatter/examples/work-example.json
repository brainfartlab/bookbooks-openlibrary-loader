{"subtitle": "The Second Volume of 'The Crown of the Isles' (Lord of the Isles)", "description": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "You can pretty much expect this story to live up to its title with, oh, so much more.  An Ogre horse, more magic that you can shake a stick at, along with a multitude of wizards, different time periods being meshed together on the same planet, an old woman becoming young again and a great evil in beasts and men called \"The Last.\"  They are darn sure working hard to make their name a reality.  This is another of Master Author David Drake's books that are almighty hard to stop reading and put down - at least I found that to be the case with me.   Give this tale a try yourself, I do believe you'll enjoy your experience."}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2020-08-14T22:32:44.026938"}, "title": "The mirror of worlds", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-12-09T19:03:27.899466"}, "covers": [1443081], "subjects": ["Wizards", "Fiction", "Fiction, fantasy, epic"], "latest_revision": 9, "key": "/works/OL1000232W", "authors": [{"type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}, "author": {"key": "/authors/OL4740632A"}}], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "revision": 9}
